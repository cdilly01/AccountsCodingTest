# AccountsCodingTest
Code is written with a modified version of the given test template in-order to support Vue.js. 
I added a few TODO's that could lead to more development, such as adding Dependency injection, where we inject base services into base classes.
The format of the solution is very similar to what I am used to day to day. 
There are some issues with formatting and css styles may not be applying correctly. 
I spent a tad more time then 1-2 hours, my apologies. It took a bit to put the solution together. Calling the api did not take much time to code.
